# JSrealB - A JavaScript bilingual text realizer for web development

**Natural language generation**, a part of artificial intelligence, studies the development of systems that produce text for different applications, for example the textual description of massive datasets or the automation of routine text creation.

The web is constantly growing and its contents, getting progressively more dynamic, us well-suited to automation by a realizer. However, existing realizers are not designed with the web in mind and their operation requires much knowledge, complicating their use.

**JSrealB is a text realizer designed specifically for the web**, easy to learn and to use. This realizer allows its user to build a variety of French and English expressions and sentences, to add HTML tags to them and to easily integrate them into web pages.

Most of the documentation is in French and can be accessed [here](https://rawgit.com/rali-udem/JSrealB/master/index.html).

However, there are a number of resources written in English available [on our website](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/rali/?q=en/jsrealb-bilingual-text-realiser), including
live demos.

## IDE

[An IDE](https://rawgit.com/rali-udem/JSrealB/master/IDE.html) is available to test and develop with JSrealB.

## Credits
JSrealB was updated, developed and brought to its current version by [Francis Gauthier](http://www-etud.iro.umontreal.ca/~gauthif) as part of his summer internship at RALI in 2016. 
JSrealB was developed in 2015 by [Paul Molins](http://paul-molins.fr/) as part of an internship from INSA Lyon spent at RALI, University of Montreal. He built on the
JSreal realizer created by [Nicolas Daoust](mailto:n@daou.st).
